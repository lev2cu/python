if():
 "state1"
	elif:
	 "state2"
		else:
		 "state3"
>>>> it can also be writen with a single line code

result = "state1" if (x<y) else "state2"



For loops:-

for x in range(5,10):
   "state1"
>>> ranges from 5 until 9 for range(5,9)

To get the index and the item:
for i, d in enumerate():
>>>> gets the index in i
